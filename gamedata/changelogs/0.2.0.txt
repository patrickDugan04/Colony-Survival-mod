0.2.0 (2017-06-22)

We’ve had an amazing launch last Friday. Major thanks to everybody who purchased the game! It was amazing to join random servers and see people enjoy the game, to read all the reviews and to watch all the videos you’ve put online.

We’ve released version 0.1.14 Friday. By Tuesday we had already reached version 0.1.18. We’ve tried to fix or improve the most common bugs and problems.

Version 0.2 is the first time since release that we add new jobs and significantly impact the production chain of existing colonies. We’ve added berry farmers, who are a source of quick and easy food in the first phase of your colony. No more two days of waiting, no more bakers, just instant food.

Bread production has become more complicated, but is ultimately more efficient than berry farming. You’ll need to place a grindstone now to recruit a colonist who converts wheat into flour. Bakers can only use flour to bake bread.

This update will hopefully help to make the first phase of the game better.

-Fixed a pathfinding precalculation bug - this fixed all the received test cases (no siege mode for 15+ minutes, where previously it triggered within minutes).

-Added various changes to increase saving consistency
-Added retrying of saving/loading files, in case the file is in use by another program (anti virus for example)

-Fixed an issue where rightclicking with items on a full stack cleared the dragged items
-Fixed forester planting sapplings that would grow outside of the forester area
