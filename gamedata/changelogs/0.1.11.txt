0.1.11 (2017-06-14)

-Added japanese localization (full credits go to KoutetsuSteel)
-Fixed a pathfinding data corruption caused by: digging a path upwards, starting from the lowest block up, through a chunk boundary
-Changed the 'idle/problem' location of npc's to their job location, to prevent colonists from bunching up & to make it more clear which colonist belongs to which job.
-Improved indicators for crafting jobs; If they are missing items to craft, they'll select a random desired recipe and show the missing item instead of the checkmark.
-Colonists will prefer to stand on the closer side of the block they're moving to, instead of going north-south-west-east in order of preference.
-Added a description to the crafting limits popup to help new players (popup.inventory.stockpiledescription).
-Added 3 missing translation entries (apply, reset in gameplay/audio menu's)
-Allow opening of the command tool popup when not aiming at a block in range
-'Fixed' dragging an area with the command tool - only clicking works
-Increased crafting limit scrolling sensitivity.

Sneaky hotfix on 2017-06-15:
